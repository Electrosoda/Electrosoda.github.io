                                    When I joined Netboom, the product was still in early development. Although there is strong cloud technology support, from the user experience perspective, it is still challenging to go through a
                                    complete
                                    process smoothly and unimpeded. At this time, Netboom has not yet reached the standard of commercial-grade products and cannot pass the market test.
                                </p>

                                <h4>The difficulties</h4>

                                <p>
                                    I adopted a heuristic evaluation method to sort out the process of the initial version to ensure that users can enter the game smoothly and perform basic operations. This is also out of the
                                    consideration
                                    of saving R&D expenses, and other methods such as user interviews will be considered after a complete user flow is available.

                                <p>
                                    Potential users of Netboom may be computer gamers familiar with major game platforms (Steam, Epic Game) or mobile phone users. They might use our products while in transit or waiting for food at a
                                    restaurant. They can share the game with friends at the party or lie on their sofa and play the game. They might want to play games they've already played on their phone, discover new ones, browse
                                    reviews, or share them with friends. Generally speaking, cloud games are still relatively unfamiliar to most groups, which is a fundamental prerequisite.

                                    These are screenshots from an earlier version. First of all, the interface is very complicated and unclear, and second, the menu's functions are incomplete. The language doesn't precisely correspond
                                    to
                                    common sense,
                                    either. These would be very confusing for a new user who has no basics. The visual design is also relatively fragmented, with room for improvement in consistency and aesthetics.

                                    To ensure the primary process first, I decided to focus on adjusting the keyboard layout settings for the above content. Based on the preset keyboard, a custom layout function is developed. I also
                                    Re-standardize the

                                    Regarding the game interface, menu operations at the Netboom level are essential. Based on the characteristics of Cloud Game, Netboom can provide very rich functions. How to leave room for future

                                    maintaining usability is a big challenge. I compared the advantages and disadvantages of the popular game menu interfaces on the market and the corresponding operation modes. I designed a clearer and
                                    easier-to-use
                                    menu structure more suitable for Netboom.

                                    test recruited 5 English speakers from different countries and races to our company in Shanghai. To get more inclusive information, the participants are both game novices and professional players. The

                                    Based on user research, I reorganised the main points of the product and formulated phased goals. Two main parts make up Netboom's product structure. The outer part is the App interface, and the inner
                                    part is after
                                    entering the game (the game interface). To ensure the integrity and ease of use of the primary
                                    process and allow users to operate independently, after discussions with the product team, development team and stakeholders, we decided to start with the App interface and gradually improve it to the
                                    game interface.
                                </p>

                                    more
                                    prevalent in
                                    European and American markets. However, the concept of cloud games is still relatively unfamiliar to most users. If it is too flattened, it will only be counterproductive. Some product homepages are
                                    flooded with
                                    subscriptions or advertisements, which is not desirable. Profit is important, but too much advertising is one factor that hinders users from continuing to learn about a brand-new product. There are
                                    still
                                    many points

                                    For the second user test, we recruited participants in Shanghai and interviewed users in the United States online. This time the insights focus on the game interface, and it is worth mentioning that

                                        Some essential functions require a more prominent entry. Most participants didn't notice the ability to switch between mouse and touch modes. And in fact, we provide a gamepad mode, and all
                                        participants do not
                                        know they can connect to a controller.

                                        The gaming keyboard customisation system needs more concise and easy-to-understand menus and instructions. Most users don't know that it is possible to customise the keyboard.

                                        Operations related to the typing keyboard need to be simplified. There are many steps to call up the keyboard, and the keyboard style will block the field of vision and other problems, which
                                        seriously

                                        Mouse mode needs to be considered again. The actual effect of the mouse mode is not good. The learning time is extended, the accuracy is also technically challenging, and it does not fit the

                                    The keyboard in the game is a very tricky point. It is necessary to realise the rich functions of computer games on the mobile phone screen while ensuring ease of use.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        After focusing on the button operation of dozens of popular games, we supplemented the preset button system and designed a new custom button system. Custom functions have been the focus of
                                        development
                                        in the
                                        subsequent iterations. Although it is a technical difficulty, it is also the key to improving the game experience.

                                    <li>Netboom works well in gamepad mode, which is beyond our expectations. I've noticed that many big games natively support controller mode, so why not use an already successful design? In addition to
                                        adding an entry
                                        prompt to the controller mode, after confirming with the technical team, I proposed to add a virtual controller button mode and design a separate icon entry for it in the menu. In this way,
                                        players
                                        without a
                                        controller can also experience the controller mode, which also coincides with Netboom's original intention to solve the lack of hardware devices for users. The virtual controller mode function has
                                        succeeded and
                                        even become the most used mode.

                                        Touch mode takes precedence. We have mouse mode. You can control the mouse on the screen by dragging. We also have a touch mode similar to the touch on a normal mobile phone. Contrary to
                                        expectations,
                                        two rounds
                                        of user interviews and
                                        background data show that the touch mode is more suitable for mobile phone scenarios. I proposed making the touch mode the default and the mouse an optional feature. Within one month, we can see
                                        that
                                        the in-game
                                        usage time has increased significantly, while most users go with the touch mode, and very few users choose the mouse mode.

                                        As for the typing keyboard, I found in my research that typing is a critical function that is frequently used. To do this, I reorganised the interactive flow of typing and gave it a separate

                                        the menu.

                                    products to
                                    correct grammar and diction together. After we launched the different localised versions, many users chose to use their native language and received positive market feedback.

                                    After we officially launched the product, I also participated in the daily work of operation teams while doing relative market research, such as implementing the customer service system and social

                                    started to be responsible for expanding the Middle East market. I focus on localisation and publicity in line with local preferences at the same time. The advertisement I am in charge of has achieved

                                    After the foundation of the game interface is finished, I continued to study the direction of game interaction in depth. Key combinations are a very common function in games, whether launching special
                                    skills or
                                    switching items. Netboom has implemented a custom key layout to place any key on the phone screen. But putting fifteen function keys on a palm-sized screen is not suitable, and it is also challenging
                                    to
                                    press
                                    multiple keys simultaneously while holding the phone. With the joint efforts of the technical department, the combination key function has been launched. I worked with the operation team to supplement
                                    various popular
                                    games' preset combination keys so players could initialise the settings easily.

                                <p>
                                    This project started from 0, and I explored and grew with the team. As the sole UX designer, I feel a great responsibility. At the same time, I also had a lot of room to play.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to starting from the experience point of view, I was also responsible for the product management work related to the UX requirements I proposed. In the joint work with the product team and
                                    investors, I
                                    understand and practice product thinking better. For any decision, I need to look at the problem from a higher perspective, such as how to grasp the relationship with users, balance benefits and
                                    experience, etc.
                                    These are precious experiences.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is worth mentioning that I participated in the operation work. While conducting global market user research, I was also responsible for relative countries‘ advertising work. I achieved pretty good
                                    results,
                                    directly opening up the Middle East market for the product. This is also a great inspiration to me. When making a global product, an in-depth understanding of local culture is a very important part, and
                                    sometimes it
                                    can bring unexpected benefits.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Collaborate across teams. Our operation team usually has a lot of contact with users. I found that understanding and participating in operation work greatly helped UX research. In the communication with
                                    the technical
                                    team, I also took the initiative to learn and understand a lot of technical content, which is beneficial to my work and helps the coordination of different departments invisibly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is a precious experience. I am very grateful to the company and colleagues for trusting me with their encouragement and help. It is very exciting and inspiring that the products I participated in can
                                    reach the
                                    hands of people worldwide. This is why I love UX design.
